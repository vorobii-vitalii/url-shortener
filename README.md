URL Shortener project implemented using technologies mentioned below:
1. Spring Framework (Spring Core, Spring MVC, Spring Data Mongo, Spring Test)
2. MongoDB as database
3. JUnit 5, Mockito, Hamcrest for testing
4. Tomcat 9 as application server
5. Maven as a build tool
6. Docker/Docker-compose for deployment


Project was mainly implemented for educational purpose to get some hands-on experience with MongoDB, Docker and Spring Framework without Spring Boot :)
